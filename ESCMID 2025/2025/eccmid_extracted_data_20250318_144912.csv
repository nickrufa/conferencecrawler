It will give an overview of the current pipeline, highlighting promising candidates, progress toward regulatory approval, and ongoing challenges in addressing multidrug-resistant pathogens. 
The session will also explore the scientific barriers to discovering novel antibacterial agents, from complex pathogen biology to technical limitations in screening and development in a field historically considered scientifically saturated. 
Furthermore, the rising threat of fungal infections, focusing on advancements in the antifungal pipeline and strategies to address fungal infections will also be covered and finally, a critical examination of precision medicine approaches, will also be given, weighing the potential benefits of targeted therapies against the complexities of implementation in acute settings.",,"Douglas HUSEBY, SwedenChair; Jean-Francois TIMSIT, FranceChair","Antibacterial therapies in clinical development [Valeria GIGANTE, Switzerland] || Challenges of finding new anti-infectives against bacterial pathogens [Martin EMPTING, Germany] || Antifungal drugs in clinical development [Oliver A.

Featuring two contrasting presentations, it highlights the diverse perspectives shaping this debate. The pro will focus on the urgent need for new antibiotics as resistance renders current treatments ineffective, threatening modern medical practices such as surgery and cancer therapy.
The con will offer a counterpoint, arguing for prioritising global initiatives to reduce infection and resistance rates, such as antibiotic stewardship, infection prevention, and equitable access, over developing new drugs.",,"Ursula THEURETZBACHER, AustriaChair","Yes: antibacterial resistance threatens medical outcomes [Evelina TACCONELLI, Italy] || No: the bang for buck lies elsewhere' [Marc MENDELSON, South Africa]"

These patients are frequently colonised with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, following healthcare system exposure due to e.g. pneumonia and overuse of antibiotics. These colonised patients may be super-spreaders of MDR bacteria in LTCF and, in addition, cause an influx of MDR bacteria into acute care hospitals. Admission restrictions of colonised patients needing contact isolation may negatively impact patient prognosis and limit their quality of care. Infection prevention measures are essential for protecting elderly patients but may negatively impact the rehabilitation of colonised patients.
