# IDWeek 2025 PWA: Comprehensive MSL Team Collaboration Platform

## Executive Summary
A Progressive Web App designed for Medical Science Liaison teams to maximize conference ROI through collaborative intelligence gathering, real-time coordination, and seamless data export integration. Enhanced based on insights from Erica Fernandez (MSL) transcript analysis.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Data Layer & Sync Strategy
```
Conference Data Sources:
├── IDWeek 2025 Session Data (JSON/CSV from crawler)
├── Poster Database (2,169+ posters)
├── Speaker/Faculty Intelligence 
├── Real-time Team Annotations
├── KOL Interaction Records
└── Territory/Therapeutic Area Mappings
```

**Offline-First Design:**
- IndexedDB for local storage (supports 50MB+ datasets)
- Service Worker with selective sync strategies
- Background sync when connectivity restored
- Conflict resolution for team edits

### 2. Team Collaboration Features

**Real-Time Coordination Dashboard:**
- Live team member locations/session attendance
- Shared priority ranking system
- Conflict avoidance (multiple people at same session)
- Team chat with session-specific threads
- Shared notes with version control

**Role-Based Access:**
- Team Lead: Full coordination view, export privileges
- MSL: Personal schedule + team visibility
- Guest/Client: Read-only access to deliverables

### 3. SMS Integration System
Since PWAs can't use native push notifications on iOS:

**SMS Gateway Integration:**
- Twilio/AWS SNS for message delivery
- Event-triggered notifications:
  - Session starting in 15 minutes
  - Team member needs backup at high-priority session
  - New competitive intelligence added
  - Schedule conflicts detected
  - Daily digest of team activities

**SMS Commands:**
- Text "STATUS" → Get team overview
- Text "SCHEDULE" → Get personal day schedule  
- Text "PRIORITY" → Get top 5 sessions for your territory

### 4. Intelligence & Prioritization Engine

**Session Scoring Algorithm:**
```javascript
sessionScore = (
  therapeuticRelevance * 40% +
  speakerImportance * 25% + 
  competitorPresence * 20% +
  clientInterest * 15%
)
```

**Filters & Categories:**
- Therapeutic Areas (Oncology, Infectious Disease, etc.)
- Drug Classes (Antibiotics, Antivirals, etc.)
- Session Types (Data Presentations, Symposia, Posters)
- Competitor Companies
- Key Opinion Leaders
